Take it and take it and take it and take it and take it all 
Take it and take it and take it until you take us all 
Smash it and crash it and thrash it and trash it 
You're only toys 
Try it you'll like it don't hide it don't fight it, just let it out 
Steal and shoot it and kill it or take another route 
Take it and take it and take it 
You know they're only toys 

Devour Devour 
Suffocate your own empire 
Devour Devour 
It's your final hour 

Devour Devour 
Stolen like a foreign soul 
Devour Devour 
What a way to go 

You want it you want it you want it 
Well here it is 
Everything everything everything 
Isn't so primitive 

Take it and take it and take it and take it and take it all 
Nobody nobody wants to feel like this 
Nobody nobody wants to live like this 
Nobody nobody wants a war like this 

Devour Devour 
Suffocate your own empire 
Devour Devour 
It's your final hour


Devour Devour 
Stolen like a foreign soul 
Devour Devour 
What a way to go 
What a way to go 

Diving down 
Round and round 
diving down 
round and round 

Devour Devour 
Suffocate your own empire 
Devour Devour 
It's your final hour 

Devour Devour 
Stolen like a foreign soul 
Devour Devour 
What a way to go 

Devour Devour 
Suffocate your own empire 
Devour Devour 
It's your final hour 

Devour Devour 
Stolen like a foreign soul 
Devour Devour 
What a way to go 
What a way to go
