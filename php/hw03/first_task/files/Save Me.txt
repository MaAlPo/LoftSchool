I got a candle
And I've got a spoon
I live in a hallway with no doors
And no rooms

Under a windowsill
They all were found
A touch of concrete within the doorway
Without a sound

Someone save me if you will
And take away all these pills
And please just save me if you can
From the blasphemy in my wasteland

How did I get here
And what went wrong
Couldn't handle forgiveness
Now I'm far beyond gone

I can hardly remember
The look of my own eyes
How can I love this a life so dishonest
It made me compromise

Someone save me if you will

And take away all these pills
And please just save me if you can
From the blasphemy in my wasteland

Jump in the water
Jump in with me
Jump on the alter
Lay down with me

The hardest question to answer
Is why

Why

Someone save me if you will
And take away all these pills
And please just save me if you can
From the blasphemy in my wasteland

Someone save me
Someone save me
Somebody save me
Somebody save me
Please don't erase me
