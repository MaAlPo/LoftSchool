Send away for a priceless gift
One not subtle, one not on the list
Send away for a perfect world
One not simply, so absurd
In these times of doing what you're told
Keep these feelings, no one knows

What ever happened to the young man's heart
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

[Chorus:]
And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
Swimming through the ashes of another life
No real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

Send a message to the unborn child
Keep your eyes open for a while
In a box high up on the shelf, left for you, no one else
There's a piece of a puzzle known as life
Wrapped in guilt, sealed up tight

What ever happened to the young man's heart
Swallowed by pain, as he slowly fell apart

[Chorus]

Everyone's pointing their fingers
Always condemning me
And nobody knows what I believe
I believe

[Chorus]

And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45,
And I'm swimming through the ashes of another life
There's no real reason to accept the way things have changed
Staring down the barrel of a 45

45
Staring down the barrel of a 45
